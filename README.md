## Number Guessing Game ðŸŽ¯

This is a simple Java-based console game where the player has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100 within a limited number of trials.

---

### How to Play
1. The program will randomly generate a number between **1** and **100**.
2. You have **10 attempts** to guess the correct number.
3. After each guess, the program will provide feedback:
   - **Too low**: The guessed number is smaller than the target.
   - **Too high**: The guessed number is larger than the target.
4. If you guess the number within the allowed attempts, you'll win! ðŸŽ‰
5. If you exhaust all attempts, the correct number will be revealed. ðŸ˜”

### Code Overview

- **Random Number Generation**:
  A random number between 1 and 100 is generated using the formula:

  ```java
  int n = 1 + (int) (100 * Math.random());
  ```

- **User Input**:
  The program takes guesses from the user using a `Scanner` object:

  ```java
  Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
  int guess = sc.nextInt();
  ```

- **Game Logic**:
  The game provides feedback (`Too high`, `Too low`, or `Congratulations!`) based on the guessed number.
